# 🎙️ Voice-Assisted Virtual Cart for Blind and Elderly Users

##  Project Overview
Shopping in modern retail environments relies heavily on visual interfaces, creating accessibility challenges for blind and elderly users. This project presents a Voice-Assisted Virtual Cart that enables independent shopping through voice interaction, computer vision, and AI-powered assistance.

The system integrates speech recognition, real-time object detection, automated billing, and text-to-speech feedback to provide an inclusive, hands-free shopping experience.
